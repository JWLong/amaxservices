	<p>We test backflow prevention devices, which are important because they keep sewage from mixing with the fresh water.</p>
	<p>If the pressure of the main water line is reduced, sewage can creep in, with nasty results.</p>
	<p>In most circumstances, testing of backflow prevention devices is mandated by the city on a yearly basis.</p>
	<p>Typically, this affects business owners and residential homeowners who have sprinkler systems or pools.</p>

	<h1>So... what is an RPZ anyway?</h1>
	<p>An RPZ is a bit of plumbing meant to keep sewage from seeping back into the fresh water. Proper maintenance keeps us from having to worry about such a possibility eleven months out of the year but, once a year we need to check it.</p>
