		<p> We test backflow prevention devices, which are important because they keep sewage from mixing with the fresh water. </p>
		<p> If the pressure of the main water line is reduced, sewage can creep in, with nasty results. </p>
		<p> In most circumstances, testing of backflow prevention devices is mandated by the city on a yearly basis. </p>
		<p> Typically, this affects business owners and residential homeowners who have sprinkler systems or pools. </p>

		<h1> So... what is an RPZ anyway? </h1>
		<p>
			An RPZ is a bit of plumbing meant to keep sewage from seeping back into the fresh water. Proper maintenance keeps us from 
			having to worry about such a possibility eleven months out of the year but, once a year we need to check it.
