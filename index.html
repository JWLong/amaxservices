			<h2> We're here to help </h2>
				<p>
			We test backflow prevention devices, which are important because they keep contaminated water from mixing with the fresh water. If the 		pressure of the main water line is reduced, sewage can creep in, with nasty results. In most circumstances, testing of backflow prevention devices is mandated by the city on a yearly basis. Typically, this affects business owners and residential homeowners who have sprinkler systems or pools.

			<h2> So... what is an RPZ anyway? </h2>
				<p>
			An RPZ is a bit of plumbing meant to keep sewage from seeping back into the fresh water. Proper maintenance keeps us from 
having to worry about such a possibility eleven months out of the year but, once a year we need to check it. With any luck, yours will look something like the one on the right. They are usually covered with a plastic box but, sometimes, they are covered with a fake rock. Also, some of the more massive RPZs will be in a special indoor room... They come in all shapes and sizes... but typically, they're small. And in a boring green box.
